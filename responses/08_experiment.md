##  Time for you to explore

Take a few minutes to play with the current code you have.  I don't suggest editing the `main.js` file, rather I think there is a lot to gain by changing the `my-workflow.yml` file to include or exclude certain input parameters. 

### :keyboard: Activity: Try these things

1. Remove all the input parameters from the `my-workflow.yml` file.  What happens when your Action executes?
2. Add all three input parameter and be explicit with their values in the `my-workflow.yml` file.  What happens when your Action executes?
3. Specify only the `third-greeting` input parameter in the `my-workflow.yml` file.  what happens when your Action executes?

When you are finished experimenting and examining the results merge this pull request into the **master** branch.  

Our next lesson will show you how to add external libraries to an Action as well as interact with external APIs.

When I notice that you have merged this branch I will open a **new issue** in your repository to continue guiding you.
